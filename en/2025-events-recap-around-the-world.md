* *By the end of 2025, the community had grown in depth, with builders moving from showing up to shipping and collaborating.*

## Overview

In 2025, Sui showed up in person more than ever before. More than 13,000 people attended Sui-hosted events across 17 stops worldwide.

From the anchor of Sui Basecamp, to new formats like SuiFest, and community-centered gatherings around the world, Sui events became places where builders shipped, partnerships formed, and local communities found their footing.

Across these events, the community launched products, formed new collaborations, and engaged hands-on with parts of the Sui Stack that didn’t exist a year earlier.

Wrapping up our End of Year series, this article looks back at a few standout moments from Sui events in 2025.

## Sui Basecamp Dubai: Where Sui’s Full Stack Came Together

[Sui Basecamp](https://sui.io/basecamp?ref=blog.sui.io) remained the centerpiece of the Sui events calendar, bringing more than 2,000 attendees from over 90 countries together. [This year’s edition](https://blog.sui.io/basecamp-2025-dubai-stack-btcfi-ai/) highlighted how far Sui has come as a complete platform for building decentralized products.

From deep technical sessions on decentralizing every layer of an app tech stack with [Walrus](https://www.walrus.xyz/?ref=blog.sui.io), [Seal](https://seal.mystenlabs.com/?ref=blog.sui.io), and [radical interoperability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzddY2U2hfs\&list=PL9t2y-BKvZBSu6bJb0z3uDLykL7nu7Vvm\&index=5\&ref=blog.sui.io), to discussions around a rapidly maturing financial layer powering next-gen DeFi and [Bitcoin Finance](https://sui.io/btcfi-bitcoin-defi-on-sui?ref=blog.sui.io), Basecamp painted a clear picture of Sui as an end-to-end, decentralized environment for building real applications.

Advancements across the Sui Stack made Basecamp a milestone not just for what was announced, but for how those pieces came together — reinforcing Sui’s expanding role as a platform for high-performance, user-friendly apps built on a unified decentralized stack.

## SuiFest Singapore: The Largest Community Gathering Yet

[SuiFest](https://blog.sui.io/suifest-singapore-event-2025/) brought more than 4,000 builders and community members together in one place, marking Sui’s largest in-person gathering to date.

The event coincided with major ecosystem launches, including [suiUSDe](https://blog.sui.io/suig-ethena-suiusde-stablecoin/), expanding Sui’s growing financial stack, and [SuiBall](https://www.suiball.com/?ref=blog.sui.io), a new hardware wallet designed for secure, native interaction with Sui assets. Together, these releases highlighted how Sui is supporting both sophisticated onchain finance and more accessible, user-friendly experiences.

SuiFest also put builders on center stage. Through live demos and community activations, builders showcased real products across the ecosystem. [Sui Tank](https://blog.sui.io/sui-tank-suifest-2025/) raised the stakes, giving teams a live stage to pitch ideas to judges, including [Kevin O’Leary](https://kevinoleary.com/?ref=blog.sui.io). Together, these moments reflected a clear shift from experimentation to confident building and shipping on Sui.

## Sui in Seoul: A Full Week of Innovation at KBW

[Sui in Seoul](https://blog.sui.io/kbw-2025-impact-builder-house-seoul/) unfolded as a full week of activity across [Korea Blockchain Week](https://koreablockchainweek.com/?ref=blog.sui.io), with more than 5,000 attendees engaging across multiple events. From early conversations at EastPoint: Seoul to a strong presence at KBW: IMPACT, Sui was part of discussions spanning regulation, AI, gaming, and the future of onchain applications in the region.

The week culminated with Sui Builder House: APAC, where hundreds of builders, partners, and community members gathered for a full day of programming. Announcements from partners such as [t’order](https://blog.sui.io/torder-power-stablecoin-payments/) and [CUDIS](https://blog.sui.io/cudis-longevity-protocol/), alongside demos of [Slush](https://slush.app/?ref=blog.sui.io), [Seal](https://seal.mystenlabs.com/?ref=blog.sui.io), and other parts of the Sui Stack, reinforced a broader theme: Sui is emerging as a coordination layer for real-world applications across payments, health, gaming, and beyond, anchored by a growing and engaged APAC community.

## Sui Presents Walrus @ ETHDenver: Web3’s Data Layer Goes Live

[ETHDenver](https://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.sui.io) marked a turning point with the debut of [Walrus](https://www.walrus.xyz/?ref=blog.sui.io), introduced to a packed audience. The reveal included a keynote and deep dives — alongside lighter moments like a custom Walrus snowboard raffle — but more importantly, it introduced developers to a new part of the Sui Stack that would shape how builders think about verifiable data across Web3, and how that data can be used in practice.

## Sui Connect Goes Global

What began as a small series of local gatherings in 2023 evolved into a global circuit in 2025, with seven Sui Connect events across Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Paris, and Istanbul, reaching thousands of local community members.

Each stop reflected the same core truth: local communities are the heartbeat of Sui. This showed up in the data as well. In 2025, more than a quarter of event participants were returning attendees, up from just over one in ten the year before.

Across LATAM, APAC, the Middle East, and Europe, first-time attendees became active contributors, new regional leaders emerged, and builders found collaborators they continue to work with today, turning local meetups into lasting points of connection within the global Sui community and strengthening ties across regions.

## Looking Ahead: Momentum into 2026

Every stop on the 2025 global tour reinforced the same themes:

* Sui is attracting a truly global builder community.
* New parts of the stack are expanding what’s possible onchain.
* Events are becoming inflection points for product launches and collaborations.

As we move into 2026, the energy continues to build. That momentum is translating into stronger communities and a growing pipeline of products across the ecosystem powered by the Sui Stack. The past year’s events showed a clear expansion of the community. 

Next year will be defined by acceleration.
