## Overview

In 2025, everyday interactions on Sui became simpler and more intuitive for users. 

[Getting started](https://sui.io/get-started?ref=blog.sui.io) now takes fewer steps, exploring Sui feels more straightforward, and — once onchain — there are clearer, more practical ways to participate. 

This progress wasn’t driven by one headline launch, but by steady improvements over the year across access, onchain finance, and Bitcoin-backed assets. Together, these changes make Sui feel simpler, smoother, and more intuitive every time you use it.

This article is part of Sui’s 2025 End of Year series, which reflects on the year from different perspectives. Here, the focus is on what changed for users.

## Easier Ways to Get Started

For many users, the most noticeable change in 2025 was how much easier it became to get onto Sui in the first place. 

Access to SUI expanded through major platforms like [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/us/en/crypto/SUI/?ref=blog.sui.io), giving U.S. users a straightforward way to buy and hold SUI. Availability also broadened on exchanges such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/price/sui?ref=blog.sui.io), where SUI became accessible across all 50 states, including New York. For many users, this removed friction at the very first step: buying and holding SUI.

Wallet support continued to broaden as well, letting people use Sui through tools they already rely on. [Phantom](https://phantom.com/?ref=blog.sui.io) added Sui, enabling multi-chain participants to manage Sui assets in a familiar interface. Support across additional wallets and platforms, including [Backpack](https://backpack.exchange/trade/SUI_USD?ref=blog.sui.io), further improved liquidity and reduced friction for new entrants.

Support also expanded to [Ledger Live](https://blog.sui.io/ledger-live-wallet-self-custody/), allowing users to manage SUI directly within Ledger’s native interface, one of the most widely used hardware-backed wallet experiences in crypto.

## More Familiar Onboarding

On the onboarding side, [passkeys](https://blog.sui.io/passkey-seamless-user-onboarding/) became available as a native option for apps building on Sui. Passkeys let users sign in using familiar, device-level authentication like Face ID, Touch ID, or secure hardware keys, without relying on seed phrases or passwords.

By leveraging built-in security features on modern devices, passkeys make account creation feel more like logging into a standard app, while still preserving the security properties users expect from onchain accounts.

This gave developers another way to deliver smooth, secure onboarding flows, complementing existing options on Sui such as [zkLogin](https://sui.io/zklogin?ref=blog.sui.io), which lets users get started with familiar web credentials.

## One-Click Paths Into DeFi

In 2025, the introduction of [Slush Strategies](https://slush.app/guides/slush-strategies?ref=blog.sui.io) marked a shift toward simpler DeFi participation. [Slush](https://slush.app/?ref=blog.sui.io), a Sui-native wallet, lowered the barrier for people curious about DeFi by reducing the need to navigate multiple protocols directly.

Slush Strategies offers a one-click entry point to curated DeFi opportunities, accessible from the wallet. By bringing key choices into a single, guided flow, this approach prioritises ease over complexity and helps users engage with onchain finance more comfortably, without needing to manage every step themselves.

## Bitcoin-Backed Finance Takes Shape

[Bitcoin Finance (BTCfi)](https://sui.io/btcfi-bitcoin-defi-on-sui?ref=blog.sui.io) emerged as one of the most active areas of user interest on Sui in 2025. Over the year, a growing set of BTC-backed assets gained real traction onchain, giving users practical ways to bring Bitcoin value into Sui and put it to work, without compromising on security or custody assumptions.

At the time of writing, nine BTC-backed assets on Sui each have more than 10 BTC circulating onchain, including wBTC, tBTC, LBTC, xBTC, WBTC, enzoBTC, MBTC, YBTC.B, and LayerZero-enabled BTC. 

For users, this translated into real choice: multiple issuers, trust models, and ways to use BTC on Sui allowing people to select the security model that they prefer rather than forcing a single approach. 

As BTC-backed liquidity continues to deepen, users have more options to trade, earn yield, and interact with Bitcoin-anchored value in ways that were previously inaccessible.

## Looking Ahead

As 2025 draws to a close, the cumulative effect of these changes is clear. Using Sui now feels more straightforward, familiar, and approachable than it did at the start of the year. What began as a series of practical improvements across access, onboarding, and onchain activity has added up to a simpler, more intuitive experience overall.

That foundation now sets the direction for what comes next. As the ecosystem continues to grow, the focus remains on helping more people discover Sui, explore what it offers, and keep coming back with confidence. The work continues.
