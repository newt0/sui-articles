[How to DeFi on Sui](https://blog.sui.io/how-to-defi-on-sui/)

Whether you’re looking to swap tokens, dive into the world of NFTs, or simply lend your assets to earn rewards, Sui’s DeFi ecosystem has something for you. Sui DeFi is filled with uniquely powerful applications, thanks to native Sui primitives. [These primitives help DeFi apps](https://blog.sui.io/sui-primitives-help-defi-flourish/) on Sui address common challenges such as liquidity bootstrapping via [DeepBook](https://www.deepbook.tech/?ref=blog.sui.io).

A healthy DeFi ecosystem is made of a few cornerstone app types such as borrow and lending protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXes), and NFT marketplaces. Enabled by Sui’s powerful primitives, the security of the [Move programming language](https://sui.io/move?ref=blog.sui.io), and the ingenuity of the Sui builder community, Sui DeFi offers experiences unlike anything else in Web3.

After [getting started on Sui](https://blog.sui.io/how-to-get-started-with-sui/) and learning about the [role of staking in DeFi](https://blog.sui.io/how-to-stake-on-sui/), it’s time to get an understanding of Sui’s DeFi landscape. 

## DeFi on Sui

In other DeFi ecosystems, users often encounter friction points, especially when new to Web3. For example, submitting separate transactions to allow an app access to your assets can be cumbersome and requires gas fees. On Sui, there is no need for approval transactions, as a result of its [object-oriented architecture](https://blog.sui.io/all-about-objects/), making DeFi activities smoother and more user-friendly.

Gas fees and transaction speed are crucial factors in DeFi. On Sui, [gas fees](https://blog.sui.io/gas-fees-explained/) are not only low but are also stable, ensuring predictability even during high demand thanks to Sui’s gas pricing mechanism that locks in rates each epoch. Additionally, Sui’s consensus mechanism, [Mysticeti](https://sui.io/mysticeti?ref=blog.sui.io), finalizes transactions in under a second, offering the lowest latency in Web3 taking Sui DeFi to the next level.

## How to DeFi

New DeFi users may find the first steps in interacting with an app to be a bit unfamiliar. Fortunately, most DeFi apps have very similar steps required. The first step is to connect your Sui wallet. There is a ‘Connect Wallet’ button usually found front and center or in the upper right corner of a webpage. When connecting a wallet, there will be multiple wallet options and you may even see the ability to login using a social account, such as Google, via [zkLogin](https://sui.io/zklogin?ref=blog.sui.io). After selecting the wallet app and specific account to connect, you're ready to start interacting with the app.

Turbos allows users to connect to their wallet directing from the trading interface.

If you have multiple accounts, switching between them varies by app and wallet. Some apps offer seamless switching and some require you to disconnect, switch accounts, and reconnect. You may also need to disconnect from your wallet as well.

In Sui Wallet, you can see what app it is connected to at the top center of the window.

Next, it’s important to understand the various factors that may be worthy of consideration. For example, when considering a swap, it’s helpful to be aware you may incur slippage and gas fees. Slippage is the difference between the expected and actual price of your swap, while gas fees are the costs of processing your transaction. If you’re exploring options like borrowing assets, it’s common that lending might be required first. Understanding these basic concepts can be helpful in navigating DeFi with more confidence but no matter what path you choose, doing your own research and consulting with your advisors is always encouraged.
