Today, Sui, a leading layer-one built for mass adoption is pleased to announce [NEAR](https://www.near.org/?ref=blog.sui.io) has added support for the Sui blockchain on [NEAR Intents](https://www.near.org/intents?ref=blog.sui.io), a product built on the NEAR blockchain, enabling Sui users to seamlessly interact across 20 chains and more than 80 assets with speed and simplicity. The integration enables users to instantly swap assets from other chains — including NEAR, BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, ZEC,  and more —directly into Sui, without the need for bridges or intermediary tools. 

NEAR Intents are a new paradigm for cross-chain coordination. Instead of navigating traditional smart contract flows, users express what they want to do, and those requests are routed and executed by solvers that determine the most efficient fulfilment path. The result is the same as a cross-chain DEX interaction, but with a far superior user experience.

With Intents, Sui users can now swap assets from other major chains directly into the Sui ecosystem in just seconds, without needing to manage gas on multiple chains or navigate complex UIs. Whether it’s swapping, conducting OTC trades where the price is set manually, or sending gift links for friends and family to redeem assets, the experience is personal and frictionless, without giving up security or control. 

“We’re excited to welcome the Sui community into the NEAR Intents ecosystem and unified liquidity layer,” said Illia Polosukhin, co-founder of NEAR Protocol. “Swapping native assets in just one click brings true interoperability to all of Web3 and unlocks powerful new experiences in DeFi and AI for developers innovating on Sui.” 

Enhanced interoperability is often seen as a growth flywheel and comes at a critical time, as Sui’s DeFi momentum continues to accelerate, with over $1.7 billion in TVL, placing it 9th among all blockchains. In the past 30 days alone, Sui recorded more than $8.1 billion in DEX volume, ranking 8th across the industry. Sui’s stablecoin market cap surged to over $1 billion in June, representing more than 180 percent growth since the start of the year.

“This integration is what crypto is all about: empowering users to exchange value directly, on their terms,” said Sui Foundation Managing Director Christian Thompson. “With Intents-based swaps live, Sui users can now trade, gift, and coordinate value in ways that are fast, private, and intuitive, while developers have a powerful new arsenal to embed seamless, peer-to-peer functionality into their apps without the overhead of bridging or complex infrastructure.” 

“This is what crypto should feel like: fast, simple, and under your control,” said [Alex Shevchenko](https://x.com/alexauroradev?s=11\&ref=blog.sui.io), *Co-Founder and CEO of* [Aurora Labs](https://x.com/alexauroradev?s=11\&ref=blog.sui.io) and [Defuse](https://defuselabs.org/?ref=blog.sui.io). “With this integration, we’re bringing the world closer to Sui’s ecosystem. Anyone can now swap assets across 20+ chains into Sui in seconds, without the need for bridges, gas juggling, or friction. That’s the power of Intents: abstracting away complexity while keeping everything on-chain, secure, and composable.”

This integration is live and ready to use. Developers can already incorporate NEAR Intents directly into their Sui apps, enhancing functionality and user reach. In the coming weeks, additional Sui-native tokens will be supported, further expanding the utility of this integration.
