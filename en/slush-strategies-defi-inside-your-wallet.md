## Overview

Decentralized finance (DeFi) lets you put your crypto to work on the blockchain and earn returns. It’s powerful, but using it often means figuring out different apps and unfamiliar steps. That friction prevents many people from getting started. That’s why we built Slush: a simple, cross-platform wallet that makes using Sui feel as easy as any everyday app.

Today, Slush takes another step forward. Say hello to Slush Strategies, a new, simple way to earn onchain. There’s no need to visit external apps. Just tap and earn. In this blog, we’ll explain Slush, break down Strategies, and show you how it simplifies DeFi.

## What Is Slush? The Easiest Way to Explore Sui

Slush is a simple crypto wallet that makes using Sui feel effortless. If you’ve never used a crypto wallet before, think of it like a clean, modern app for holding and managing your digital assets. You can create a wallet in seconds simply by signing in with your Google account; there’s no seed phrase to store and no complicated setup to navigate.

With Slush, you can keep your tokens, send and receive crypto, explore apps across the Sui ecosystem, and manage everything from a single, familiar interface. Until now, you could earn onchain too, but doing it meant leaving the wallet and completing the process using an external decentralized application’s interface. That’s what Strategies unlocks.

## Introducing Slush Strategies: Real Yield, Zero Friction

Slush Strategies makes the DeFi experience accessible from your wallet. Instead of jumping between apps, Strategies brings everything into one clear, guided flow. 

You start by choosing the type of strategy you want to use, such as a principal-protected stablecoin option, or a higher-yield option using assets like SUI. From there, Slush helps you prepare the right token and submit the transaction to the underlying DeFi protocols to handle execution. 

Everything stays transparent, and you don’t need to leave the wallet to get started. Slush Strategies takes the power of DeFi and makes it feel as intuitive as any everyday app.

Slush will continue to add support for more assets and protocols over time, giving users an expanding range of strategies to choose from.

## How Slush Strategies Works: A Simple Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1:  Choose how you want to earn. Pick the type of asset you want to use (stablecoins, SUI, WAL, etc). Each strategy shows the protocol and projected yield.

Step 2: Slush makes sure you are using the right token. Every strategy requires a specific asset. If you don’t have it, Slush will guide you through converting. For example, if a strategy uses USDC but you only hold SUI, Slush will help you convert SUI into USDC.

Step 3: Tap to submit. Slush bundles the necessary steps — like swapping, depositing, and gas preparation — into a single onchain transaction and submits it to the underlying protocol for execution. What normally takes multiple steps across multiple apps now happens in one go

Step 4: Rewards are handled automatically. As your position earns, claims and compounding happen in the background without extra transactions. Set it and forget it.

Step 5. Check in or withdraw anytime. Your positions sit in the \[Strategies] view under \[Earn], where you can track performance, add to a position, or withdraw with a few taps.

## Where the Yield Comes From

Before you tap into a strategy, it helps to understand what’s generating your returns. Onchain yield comes from real activity across Sui’s DeFi ecosystem — such as borrowers paying interest, protocols reinvesting returns, and automated strategies producing yield. 

With Slush Strategies, you access those same opportunities from Sui DeFi protocols in a simpler way, without needing to navigate each protocol yourself.

### Lending, Vaults, and Automated Yield

Instead of sorting through lending markets, vaults, or protocols yourself, Slush shows you certain available earning options, the projected APY, and the protocol powering each one. 

Your deposit might go into a lending pool (like those on Alphalend, where borrowers pay interest), or into an automated yield vault (like those on Ember, which reinvest rewards). 

The source of yield is transparent and provided directly from the protocols through their APIs. With Slush, you always know exactly which protocol you’re interacting with.

### Why Slush Strategies Makes It Easy

Normally, accessing these opportunities means swapping into the right token, opening external apps, approving contracts, managing gas, and manually compounding rewards. 

Slush Strategies turns all of that into a single, seamless experience. It’s the same real, onchain yield you’d get by doing everything manually. Just with a lot less friction.

What’s important is this: Slush isn’t creating new yield. It’s simplifying access to yield that already exists. You still earn directly from the underlying protocols. Slush just removes the pain points. It’s the same DeFi power. Just without the DeFi admin.

## Why All This Matters

DeFi has long offered strong earning opportunities, but the complexity keeps many people out. Strategies simplifies the entire journey into one clear flow, lowering the barrier for newcomers and giving experienced users a faster, cleaner way to participate.

For users, onchain yield becomes accessible: no more juggling tabs, guessing which app to use, or worrying about missed steps. Everything is available in one place.

For protocols across Sui, Strategies increases visibility. Instead of competing for attention across multiple interfaces, protocols can be discovered and entered directly from Slush.

## Final Thoughts

Getting started with Slush Strategies is simple. 

If you already use Slush, just open the app and tap \[Earn]. You’ll see \[Strategies] waiting for you. From there, choose how you want to earn, review the details, and tap to begin. 

If you’re new to Slush, download the app, create your wallet in seconds, and add the tokens you want to use. You don’t need any prior DeFi experience. Once you’re set up, Strategies is ready to go: clear options, transparent yields, and one-tap execution. 

Onchain earning from DeFi protocols has never been this straightforward.
