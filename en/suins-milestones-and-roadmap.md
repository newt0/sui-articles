[SuiNS Achievements and Vision for the Future](https://blog.sui.io/suins-milestones-and-roadmap/)

[**Sui Name Service (SuiNS)**](https://suins.io/?ref=blog.sui.io)**,** the leading naming service on Sui, enhances onchain interactions by replacing complex wallet addresses with user-friendly, memorable names. Through its previous two years, the service has undergone refinements and improvements to better serve its mission of creating easy, human-readable identities.

Drawing on its common usage in social media, SuiNS takes it a step further and by [incorporating the ‘@’ symbol](https://blog.sui.io/suins-new-naming-standard/), making Web3 identities even more intuitive. Users familiar with tagging friends on social platforms will find SuiNS’s @name format familiar, facilitating easier transfers. 

SuiNS extends its utility with the introduction of [subnames](https://blog.sui.io/suins-subnames-advance-web3-identity/), enabling the creation of even more unique identities. This feature is especially beneficial for companies, DAOs, and other organizations seeking to create vanity names or usernames that clearly and efficiently represent their presence on the blockchain. 

Now SuiNS is about to take another huge step with [community governance](https://www.mystenlabs.com/blog/decentralization-of-suins?ref=blog.sui.io). Ensuring that the community takes the helm of decision making is crucial for a naming service to become a true public good. As SuiNS embraces a decentralized model, it's an ideal moment to reflect on its journey and look at what lies ahead.
